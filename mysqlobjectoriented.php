//Mysql object oriented 
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "username";
$password = "password";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
  die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully";
?>

/////Note on the object-oriented example above:

//$connect_error was broken until PHP 5.2.9 and 5.3.0. If you need to ensure compatibility with PHP versions prior to 5.2.9 and 5.3.0, use the following code instead:

// Check connection
//if (mysqli_connect_error()) {
 // die("Database connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
//}
